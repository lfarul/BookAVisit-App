# BookAVisit-App

This is my ASP.NET Core web application for booking medical visits. The application has been built on Model-View-Controller 
architecture which separated an application into three main components - business logic, managing http requests and views. 
For visual performance I used with Bootstrap framework and Razor views which are combinations of HTML and CS. For database connections 
I used with SQL Server Local DB. Fot the purpose of logging in / out there was an ASP.NET Core Identity mechanism implemented which 
provided support for GUI, managing users, roles, passwords, etc.
